# Calendly Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with Calendly scheduling and event management.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Calendly account with API access
- Calendly OAuth credentials

### Setting Up Calendly Developer Account

To use this server, you'll need to create a Calendly developer account and set up OAuth credentials:

1. Visit [Calendly Developer Portal](https://developer.calendly.com/create-a-developer-account)
2. Sign up or log in to your Calendly account
3. Create a new application in the developer dashboard
4. Configure the OAuth settings with your redirect URI
5. Copy the client ID and client secret for use in the OAuth configuration

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Calendly API documentation](https://developer.calendly.com/create-a-developer-account).

### Local Authentication

Local authentication uses a OAuth Configuration JSON file:

```json
local_auth/oauth_configs/calendly/oauth.json
```

Create the following file with the relevant attributes for your Calendly app:

```json
{
  "client_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "redirect_uri": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

When authorizing users, the server will automatically:

1. Redirect to Calendly's authorization URL with your configured credentials
2. Exchange the received code for an access token using Calendly's OAuth endpoints

For local development, you can authenticate using:

```bash
python src/servers/calendly/main.py auth
```

This will launch a browser-based authentication flow to obtain and save credentials.
