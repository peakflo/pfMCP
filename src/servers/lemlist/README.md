# Lemlist Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with the Lemlist API, supporting campaign management, scheduling, and outreach automation.

---

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Lemlist account with API access
- Lemlist API key (token) with appropriate permissions

---

#### How to Get Your Lemlist API Key

1. Log in to your Lemlist account.
2. Click on your profile icon (top right) and go to **Settings**.
3. Navigate to the **Integrations** or **API** section.
4. Locate your **API Key** (sometimes called a token or access key).
5. Copy the API key and keep it secure. You will be prompted to enter this during the authentication step above.

### Local Authentication

Local authentication uses your Lemlist API key. The credentials will be stored securely at:

```
local_auth/credentials/lemlist/
```

To authenticate and save credentials for local testing, run:

```bash
python src/servers/lemlist/main.py auth
```

This will prompt you to enter your Lemlist API key. After successful authentication, your credentials will be stored securely for reuse.
