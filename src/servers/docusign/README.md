### 📄 Local OAuth Credentials

Create a file named `oauth.json` in your directory (local_auth/oauth_configs/docusign/) with the following content:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri"
}
```

### 🔓 Authenticate with DocuSign

Run the following command to initiate the OAuth login:

```bash
python src/servers/docusign/main.py auth
```

This will open your browser and prompt you to log in to DocuSign. After successful authentication, the access credentials will be saved locally to:

```
local_auth/credentials/docusign/local_credentials.json
```
