# Google Sheets Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with Google Sheets.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Google Cloud project with the **Google Sheets API enabled**
- OAuth 2.0 credentials configured for desktop application access

---

### 🔐 Local Authentication

Local authentication uses a Google OAuth Configuration JSON file located at:

```
local_auth/oauth_configs/gsheets/oauth.json
```

This file can be obtained when you are creating an oauth client from google cloud applciation in the GCP console.

To authenticate and save credentials for local testing, run:

```bash
python src/servers/gsheets/main.py auth
```

After successful authentication, your credentials will be stored securely for reuse.
