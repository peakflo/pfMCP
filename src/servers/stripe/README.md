# Stripe Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with Stripe API.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Stripe account with API access
- OAuth 2.0 credentials configured for standard accounts

---

### 🔐 Local Authentication

Local authentication uses a Stripe OAuth Configuration JSON file located at:

```
local_auth/oauth_configs/stripe/oauth.json
```

Create the following file with the relevant attributes for your app:

```json
{
  "client_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", // The client_secret is your secret API key, see the Reference guides below
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

To set this up properly, refer to Stripe's official documentation for creating and managing OAuth applications:

➡️ [Stripe OAuth Standard Accounts Guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/oauth-standard-accounts#integrating-oauth)
➡️ [Stripe OAuth Reference](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/oauth-reference)

To authenticate and save credentials for local testing, run:

```bash
python src/servers/stripe/main.py auth
```

After successful authentication, your credentials will be stored securely for reuse.

You can also start the local client using the following:

```bash
python RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint http://localhost:8000/stripe/local
```
