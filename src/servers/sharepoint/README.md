```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri"

### 📌 Notes on SharePoint API Usage

- When using `site_url` parameters, provide the full URL to your SharePoint site (e.g., `https://<domain>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site_name>`)
- Most tools can use either `site_id` or `site_url` for identifying the SharePoint site
