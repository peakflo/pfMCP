### Local OAuth Credentials

Create a file named `oauth.json` in your directory (local_auth/oauth_configs/teams/) with the following content:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri"
}
```

### Authenticate with Microsoft Teams

Run the following command to initiate the OAuth login:

```bash
python src/servers/teams/main.py auth

### Notes on Microsoft Teams API Usage

- Some operations require admin permissions (like viewing all teams in the organization).
- Message content supports HTML formatting for rich text messages.
- All endpoints are RESTful and return JSON.
- Team, channel, and user IDs are required for many operations - use the appropriate listing tools first to obtain these IDs.
