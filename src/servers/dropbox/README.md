1. Go to the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Click "Create app"
3. Choose "Scoped access"
4. Choose the type of access you need
5. Name your app
6. Under "OAuth 2", note down:
   - App key (client_id)
   - App secret (client_secret)
7. Add your redirect URI
8. Under "Permissions" tab, enable these scopes:
   ```
   account_info.write
   account_info.read
   files.metadata.read
   files.metadata.write
   files.content.read
   files.content.write
   file_requests.read
   file_requests.write

   ```

### üîê Local Authentication

Create a file named `oauth_configs/dropbox/oauth.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-app-key",
  "client_secret": "your-app-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri"
}   
```

To authenticate and save credentials for local testing, run:

```bash
python -m src/servers/dropbox/main auth
```

After successful authentication, your credentials will be stored securely for reuse.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

#### Local Development

You can launch the server for local development using:

```bash
./start_sse_dev_server.sh
```

This will start the Dropbox MCP server and make it available for integration and testing.

You can also start the local client using:

```bash
python RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint http://localhost:8000/dropbox/local
```

### üìé Notes

- All paths in Dropbox should start with "/" (root directory)
- File operations are asynchronous and use thread pooling for better performance
- Upload operations support both "add" and "overwrite" modes
- The server handles pagination automatically for large directories
- All operations return standardized responses with success/error information
