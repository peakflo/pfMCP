# Patreon pfMCP Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with the Patreon API using OAuth authentication.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Patreon Developer account with an API application created
- OAuth credentials configured for your application

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Create a Patreon Developer Account

1. Go to [Patreon Developer Portal](https://www.patreon.com/portal/registration/register-clients)
2. Sign up for a developer account
3. Navigate to Client & API Keys section (top right corner)
4. Create a new Client
5. Add required details:
   - App name
   - Description
   - Redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)
   - Client API Version as `2.0`
   - All other fields are optional
6. Create the Client

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Configure OAuth Settings

1. Once the Client is created, expand the Client section and copy the Client ID and Client Secret

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Set Up Local Configuration

1. Create a new folder called `local_auth` in your project directory
2. Inside that, create a folder called `oauth_configs`
3. Inside that, create a folder called `patreon`
4. Create a new file called `oauth.json` in the `patreon` folder
5. Copy and paste this into the file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id-here",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret-here",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri-here" e.g. `http://localhost:8080`
}
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never share or commit this file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.

---

### 🔐 Step 4: Authenticate Your App

1. Open your terminal
2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   python src/servers/patreon/main.py auth
   ```
3. Log in to your Patreon account
4. Click **"Allow"** to authorize the app
5. You're now authenticated! 🎉

> You only need to do this authentication step once, unless your token expires.
