```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri" e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### 📎 Notes

- The server respects Mailchimp's API rate limits:
  - 10 requests per second
  - 1000 requests per day on the free plan
  - Custom limits for higher-tier plans
- Make sure your `.env` file contains the appropriate API keys if you're using external LLM services like Anthropic
- All operations return standardized responses with success/error information
