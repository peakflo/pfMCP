# Reddit Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with the **Reddit API**.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OAuth 2.0 credentials from a Reddit Developer App. You can create one here: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
  - You can select "web app" for type of application
  - The `client_id` will be listed below "web app" when it is created
- A local OAuth config file with your Reddit `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri`

---

### 🔐 Local Authentication

Create a file named `local_auth/reddit/oauth.json`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

To authenticate and save credentials for local testing, run:

```bash
python src/servers/reddit/main.py auth
```

After successful authentication, your credentials will be stored securely for reuse.

### ▶️ Run

#### Local Development

You can launch the server for local development using:

```bash
./start_sse_dev_server.sh
```

This will start the Reddit MCP server and make it available for integration and testing.

You can also start the local client using the following:

```bash
python RemoteMCPTestClient.py --endpoint http://localhost:8000/reddit/local
```

### 📎 Notes

- Ensure your OAuth app has the required scopes enabled: `identity`, `read`, `submit`, `edit`, `history`, `flair`
- If you're testing with multiple users or environments, use different `user_id` values.
- Make sure your `.env` file contains the appropriate API keys if you're using external LLM services like Anthropic.
