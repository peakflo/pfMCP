# OneDrive Server

pfMCP server implementation for interacting with Microsoft OneDrive.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) application registration
- OAuth 2.0 credentials with the following scopes:
  - https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
  - offline_access

### Features

- List files and folders in OneDrive
- Upload files to OneDrive
- Download files from OneDrive
- Create new folders
- Delete files and folders
- Search for files
- Generate sharing links (view-only or edit access)

### Local Authentication

1. [Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate%2Cexpose-a-web-api)
2. Add the required Microsoft Graph API permissions. Add it as a "Delegated" permission. (Files.ReadWrite.All)
3. Configure a redirect URI for your application (e.g., http://localhost:8080)
4. Get your application's client ID and client secret
5. Create an `oauth.json` file:

```
local_auth/oauth_configs/onedrive/oauth.json
```

Create the following file with the relevant attributes for your app:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "redirect_uri": "your-redirect-uri" e.g. `http://localhost:8080`
}
```

6. To set up and verify authentication, run:

```bash
python src/servers/onedrive/main.py auth
```
